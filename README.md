# Setup Guides
The following guides are meant to help with setting up computers from scratch. I wrote them for myself because sometimes Ubuntu gets all screwed up and it is easier for me just to re-install the operating system rather than spending hours or days trying to fix the OS. Nevertheless, I am sharing them with you in the hopes you will find them useful. Enjoy!
